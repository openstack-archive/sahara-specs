Backlog
^^^^^^^

This directory is for specifications that have been approved but not yet
implemented.  If you are interested in implementing one of these specifications
submit a review request moving it to the appropriate release.


The updated review should reflect the new primary assignee.  Please maintain
all previous assignees in the list of Other Contributors.

If a specification has been partially implemented, the document in the backlog
will contain information of what has been completed.
