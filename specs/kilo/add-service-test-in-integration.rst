==========================================
Add check service test in integration test
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/add-service-test-in-integration

This specification proposes to add check services tests in integration test
for CDH plugins.Currently we have added zookeeper,HBase,Flume,Sentry,Sqoop,
SOLR,Key-Value Store Indexer, and Impala services.

Problem description
===================

Currently we have enabled many new services in CDH plugin.And we want to
increase the coverage of the test cases.So we plan to add test cases in the
integration test, which will check the availability of those services by using
simple scripts like we did in map_reduce_testing.


Proposed change
===============

We plan to write test cases like the way we did in map_reduce_testing. First
copy the shell script to the node,then run this script, the script will run
basic usage of the services.

The implementation will need below changes on codes for each service:

* Add new cluster template (including all services process) in
  test_gating_cdh.py
* Add check_services.py (check all services) to check all basic usage of
  services
* Add shell scripts (check all services)
