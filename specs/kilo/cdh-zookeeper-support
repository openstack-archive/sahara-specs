CDH Zookeeper Support
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/cdh-zookeeper-support

This specification proposes to add Zookeeper support for CDH Plugin in Sahara.


Problem description
===================

Zookeeper is a centralized service to provide functions like maintaining
configuration, distributed synchronization, and providing group services.
It's important to have a Zookeeper to prevent data loss and to avoid a single
point failure(SPoF) in a cluster. It has become a basic service to deploy a
hadoop cluster in CDH environment.


Proposed change
===============

The implementation will support CDH 5.0.0.
Support Features:

* Install Zookeeper Service in a CDH cluster
* To have an option to select installing Zookeeper or not in a CDH cluster
* Most Configuration Parameters Support in a CDH cluster
