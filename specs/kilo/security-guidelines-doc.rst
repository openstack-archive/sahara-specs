=============================================
Creation of Security Guidelines Documentation
=============================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/security-guidelines-doc

As Sahara increases in functionality and complexity, the need for clear,
concise documentation grows. This is especially true for security related
topics as they are currently under-represented. This specification
proposes the creation of a document that will provide a source for security
related topics, guides, and instructions as they pertain to Sahara.


Problem description
===================

There is currently a distinct lack of centralized, security related,
documentation for Sahara. Several features have been implemented to address
security shortfalls and they could use broadened discussions of their
application and proper usage. Additionally there is no current documentation
which discusses the specific procedures for securing the individual plugin
technologies at use within Sahara.


Proposed change
===============

This specification proposes the creation of Sahara specific documentation
addressing the security concerns of users and operators. This documentation
will cover current features, best practices, and guidelines for installing and
operating Sahara.

The documentation generated by this effort will be included in the OpenStack
Security Guide[1]. Bug patches will be generated against the current OpenStack
manuals, and the OpenStack Security Group will be engaged with respect to
finalizing and including the documentation.

The process will be broken down into sub-chapter sections that will make up a
Sahara chapter for the OpenStack Security Guide. Initially these sub-chapters
will include; Sahara controller installs, current feature discussions, and
plugin specific topics.

The information provided is intended to be updated as new methodologies,
plugins, and features are implemented. It will also be open to patching
through the standard OpenStack workflows by the community at large.


Alternatives
------------

Creation of a separate document managed by the Sahara team outside the purview
of the OpenStack manuals, and distributed through the Sahara documentation.
This solution would be non-ideal as it creates an alternate path for OpenStack
manuals that is outside the expected locations for end users.

Creation of a separate document as above with the exception that it will be
maintained with the other OpenStack manuals. This option might be more
plausible than the previous, but it still suffers from the problem of creating
an alternate location for security related guidelines that is separate from
the official manual. It also bears the burden of creating a new project
within the manuals infrastructure.
