==========================================
Example Spec - The title of your blueprint
==========================================

Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/example

Introduction paragraph -- why are we doing anything? A single paragraph of
prose that operators can understand. The title and this first paragraph
should be used as the subject line and body of the commit message
respectively.

Some notes about using this template:

* Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template.

* Please wrap text at 79 columns.

* The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for
  example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/awesome-thing
  should be named awesome-thing.rst

* Please do not delete any of the sections in this template.  If you have
  nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None

* For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

* To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see:
  http://rst.ninjs.org

* If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii diagrams are
  required.  http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making
  ascii diagrams.  The reason for this is that the tool used to review specs is
  based purely on plain text.  Plain text will allow review to proceed without
  having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in gerrit.  It
  will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself.

* If your specification proposes any changes to the Sahara REST API such
  as changing parameters which can be returned or accepted, or even
  the semantics of what happens when a client calls into the API, then
  you should add the APIImpact flag to the commit message. Specifications with
  the APIImpact flag can be found with the following query:

  https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+project:openstack/sahara-specs+message:apiimpact,n,z

Problem description
===================

A detailed description of the problem:

* For a new feature this might be use cases. Ensure you are clear about the
  actors in each use case: End User vs Deployer

* For a major reworking of something existing it would describe the
  problems in that feature that are being addressed.


Proposed change
===============

Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you
propose to solve this problem?

If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In
other words, what's the scope of this effort?

Alternatives
------------

What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't
have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has
been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one.

Data model impact
-----------------

Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact
on the system.  The community often has strong opinions on how the data model
should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is
therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any
proposed changes to the data model.

Questions which need to be addressed by this section include:

* What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to
  require?

* What database migrations will accompany this change.

* How will the initial set of new data objects be generated, for example if you
  need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data
  describe how that will work.

REST API impact
---------------

Each API method which is either added or changed should have the following

* Specification for the method

  * A description of what the method does suitable for use in
    user documentation

  * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE)

  * Normal http response code(s)

  * Expected error http response code(s)

    * A description for each possible error code should be included
      describing semantic errors which can cause it such as
      inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when an
      instance is not in an appropriate state for the request to
      succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON
      schema definition do not need to be included.

  * URL for the resource

  * Parameters which can be passed via the url

* Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied
  by the caller and the response

* Discuss any policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to
  think about when defining their policy.

Other end user impact
---------------------

Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this
feature?

* Does this change have an impact on python-saharaclient? What does the user
  interface there look like?

Deployer impact
---------------

Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack
that have not already been mentioned, such as:

* What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than
  proposed (for example a flag that other hypervisor drivers might want to
  implement as well)? Are the default values ones which will work well in
  real deployments?

* Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it
  something that has to be explicitly enabled?

* If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed?

* Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those
  upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe
  any plans to deprecate configuration values or features.  For example, if we
  change the directory name that instances are stored in, how do we handle
  instance directories created before the change landed?  Do we move them?  Do
  we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will
  recreate all the instances in their cloud?

Developer impact
----------------

Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack,
such as:

* If the blueprint proposes a change to the driver API, discussion of how
  other hypervisors would implement the feature is required.

Sahara-image-elements impact
----------------------------

Does it require changes to the sahara-image-elements? If so, changes should be
described well.

Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact
---------------------------------

Does it require changes to the sahara-dashboard / horizon? If so, changes
should be described well. If it's about complex changes than probably a
separate blueprint / spec should be created for it.


Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------

Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're
throwing it out there to see who picks it up?

If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the
primary author and contact.

Primary assignee:
  <launchpad-id or None>

Other contributors:
  <launchpad-id or None>

Work Items
----------

Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be
done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people,
but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation.


Dependencies
============

* Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in sahara, or in other
  projects, that this one either depends on or is related to.

* If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used
  by Sahara, document that fact.

* Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not
  included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library?


Testing
=======

Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what
tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be
added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why
you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest
tests would need to be included.

Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware /
software configurations available)? Is this untestable in sahara-ci? If so,
are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc).


Documentation Impact
====================

What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require
donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't
repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here.


References
==========

Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any
reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your
references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are:

* Links to mailing list or IRC discussions

* Links to notes from a summit session

* Links to relevant research, if appropriate

* Related specifications as appropriate (e.g.  if it's an EC2 thing, link the
  EC2 docs)

* Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to
